The result, like his floppy haircut, is too quaint for a hero, but the rest of the cast is a sturdy gang, headed by Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein, an investigative agent with unearthly powers, and Alison Sudol as her sister Queenie, a mind-reading flirt. They are instantly clad in evening gowns—hey presto!—to enter a speakeasy, and the loveliest sight, in a movie generously laced with charm, is a strudel that makes and bakes itself in midair, at Queenie’s command, to feed the hungry Jacob. I wanted more of Samantha Morton to balance the sweetness; she plays the boss of an orphanage, a pale-eyed human bully who suspects that wizards are afoot and yearns to crush them. As often with Rowling, the details out-linger the plot, though the villain is quite a novelty—not any sort of creature but an Obscurus, a parasitic spitting cloud of wrath. It’s an expensive update on the black scrawl that appeared above Lucy’s head, in “Peanuts,” when super-crabbiness loomed. In all, the movie is a cunning and peppy surprise, dulled only by the news that no less than four sequels await.

Before you know it, there’s an escaped whatchamacallit—half platypus, half mole—filching jewellery and cash, and a mega-rhino with a glowing horn marauding through Central Park in search of a mate.

Review.create(reviewer_id: 3, movie_id: 259316, score: 3, title: "Fantastic Beasts Charts a New Path Through a Familiar World", content: "The film strains considerably under the weight of all these plot lines—it’s never fun to be the movie with the origin story. Newt, Tina, and the gang spend an inordinate amount of time tracking down all those creatures, which keeps them busy while the plot itself unspools, seemingly in the background. And I’m sorry to say that their story is not particularly compelling. Redmayne and Waterson are both terrific, charismatic actors, but they’re both tamped down here, particularly Redmayne, who is so obligated to be “whimsical” in the Rowling sense that he barely enunciates his dialogue, seemingly whispering all of it out the side of his mouth. He is so good-hearted, simple, and nondescript that it’s sort of crazy that he’s going to be the centerpiece of four or five more films. He isn’t given more motivation than “loves animals,” and an eleventh-hour attempt to give him a sad backstory feels more tacked on than anything else. Farrell is a potentially worthy villain, but he has nothing much to do more than glower and, in the climax, give way to a much more famous, but far less enjoyable, movie star. (When this “surprise” movie star is revealed, I swear, half my theater groaned.)", conclusion: "But never fear. There is time enough ahead (and more) to get to know these characters, to learn about Newt’s mysterious past love and discover whether Queenie and Kowalski have romance in their future. Originally proposed as the opening chapter of a trilogy, Fantastic Beasts has already been upgraded to serve as the first of a planned five-movie series. What could be more American than that?")
Review.create(reviewer_id: 4, movie_id: 259316, score: 4, title: "Fantastic Beasts: A Nice Place to Visit", content: "Beasts takes place during the Roaring Twenties—are we going to learn that the Depression was caused by wizards around film four?—and the plot revolves around Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a sort of Dr. Doolittle collector of the eponymous fantastic beasts. He tries to protect the creatures from extinction and predators, but foolishly, he decides to take them on a trip from England to New York City. Inevitably, a few escape, and he must track them down with Tina, a disgraced auror (Katherine Waterson), Jacob, a befuddled human (Dan Folger), and Tina’s flapper roommate (Alison Sudol). Meanwhile—and this is movie that is stuffed with meanwhiles—a rogue wizard is wreaking havoc on the human world, causing major headaches for wizard President, Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo), and her top enforcer, Graves (Colin Farrell), who may have other motives. Meanwhile, a woman runs a cruel anti-witch orphanage that may be hiding the most dangerous wizard of all. And meanwhile there’s some sort of newspaper baron (Jon Voight) who I assume will figure into all this more relevantly in future movies.", conclusion: "But even if the characters are somewhat underdeveloped, the cast does what it can to bring them to life. Redmayne is excellent as the committed but awkward magizoologist Newt, his eyes shying away from direct contact whenever possible. Fogler (Balls of Fury) is lovably lunky as Kowalski, and singer-songwriter Sudol is an unexpectedly charismatic presence as Queenie. Among the principal quartet, only Waterston’s Tina fails to make a deep impression, and this is a consequence more of the script than of her performance.")

Sure, all the fixings are there—the goblins, the spells, the magical creatures—but these were always meant to be the garnish rather than the main course. You have to care deeply about the figures at the center of all this madness, the relatable people who navigate Rowling’s narrative. But the stars of this film aren’t the people, it’s the world—a world that feels less like a new, organic story than a brand extension. Now, Harry Potter is not a terrible brand to extend; spinning off Rowling’s universe will provide more rewards than another Transformers movie. I looked forward to every Harry Potter movie, even the eighth one. But judging by the first film of Fantastic Beasts, I can’t imagine making it through four more of these things.", conclusion: "I suspect you’ll want to hang out more in this world, rather that spend time with the wizards at the center of it. It just feels a little more wheezing than you’d like it to. You think that’s a problem now? Just wait: We’ve got another decade of these movies left to go.")

We watched as Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson grew up to deliver skilled, subtle, and fascinating performances—who could have known their versatility when they were cast at the age of ten? For all the lunacy and whimsy of the Storied British Actors who surrounded these talented youths in all eight films, it was the kids who kept us all locked into focus. We cared about these strong, likeable characters, and their story kept us grounded among the thornier details of Hogwarts, Quidditch, the Death Eaters, and entire mythology of Rowling’s wider wizarding world.", conclusion: "he plot lines move along quickly, and they generally make sure to provide a good lesson. But Harry Potter felt compelled to exist, as if Rowling knew she was producing her life’s work and wanted to nail down every detail. Here, it feels again like an extension of world that she—and Warner Bros.—loved so much they didn’t want to leave it.")

Along for the ride are Tina (Katherine Waterston), a security officer with the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA), and her frizzy blond Jazz Age sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol); Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), a shifty MACUSA operative; and Jacob (Dan Fogler), a baker who gets swept up in the acceptably rendered CGI proceedings. Jacob and Queenie fall in love, and their scenes have a sweetness that reminded me of the clueless lovebirds Papageno and Papagena in Mozart’s “The Magic Flute.”", conclusion: "There’s still a lot to enjoy in Fantastic Beasts. It’s never unpleasant to luxuriate in Rowling’s wizarding world, and the movie is full of the little side gags that always populate both her books and these movies.")

Rowling has set in motion a new franchise linked tangentially to the old one. “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” the first screenplay written directly for the screen by Rowling and directed by “Harry Potter” movie veteran David Yates, is about the exploits of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), the author of a textbook on magic used by Harry Potter. Reportedly Rowling and Co. are signed up for four sequels. Here we go again.", conclusion: "Rowling has a voluminous imagination and Yates keeps things humming along, although, as was also true of many “Potter” movies, there is often too much of a good thing.")

And that’s not the half of them.  But the movie promises fantastic beasts, and fantastic they are. Here we encounter elephants seemingly bred with giant squids; enormous rhinos crossed with whales; jungle cats that puff up like blowfish; snakes with wings that grow and shrink depending on their surroundings; enormous eagles; an invisible monkey-like creature; a Groot-like stick insect; a kleptomaniacal platypus.  As Newt and his new friends chase the runaway beasts around the city, they become entwined in a variety of half-baked (and rather superfluous) subplots, ranging from the search for a child with wondrous magical abilities, an anti-witchcraft temperance society, and a shadowy figure named Gellert Grindelwald, who has the rest of the wizarding community on edge.", conclusion: "But the film is fine enough to make you forgive, if not forget, the fact that it exists primarily as a corporate enterprise and not as an imaginative tour de force. Grade: B (Rated PG-13 for some fantasy action violence.)")
Review.create(reviewer_id: 10, movie_id: 259316, score: 5, title: "Sharing new magic and setting the scene to come go hand-in-hand in an enchanting spinoff", content: "To be fair, this is an exercise in world-building, meant to lay the foundation for a staggering five movies in total (and considering Rowling’s textbook detailed 85 different beasts, there are plenty of creatures to come). Yet Rowling, who wrote the screenplay (her first), packs in enough plot to cover all future instalments – trying to follow along feels like cramming for a quiz. Unlike the previous Harry Potter films, which were set in present-day England, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them hops back in time and boards a steamer across the ocean for 1920s New York, a city whose citizens are still recovering from the war. It’s a welcome change. Director David Yates, who helmed the last four (very good) Harry Potter films, but has way less to work with here, does a remarkable job of bringing Jazz Age New York to life; the setting is one of the film’s highlights, dripping in art-deco architecture and magical speakeasies.  Arriving on Ellis Island is Newt Scamander, a “magizoologist” (basically Jane Goodall with a wand) who has come to America with only the shirt on his back and a small, leather-bound suitcase that hides an ark full of magical creatures, which are illegal in the U.S. (Redmayne plays Newt as a socially awkward young man who prefers the company of animals to his fellow wizards; the performance alternates between charming and grating.) He’s almost immediately waylaid when several beasts from his menagerie escape – they are constantly escaping; he needs better locks on that suitcase – and proceed to wreak havoc on the city.", conclusion: "Still, there are moments that transcend the rest of the film’s staid trappings. At one point, late at night, Newt invites Jacob down into his suitcase, which contains a seemingly infinite amount of space for his beasts to roam free.")

No, really – the latest entry in the seemingly unstoppable Harry Potter franchise (seven novels, eight films, a two-part play that premiered earlier this year, etc.) was first alluded to in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, nearly 20 years ago now, as a textbook to be studied at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Later, author J.K. Rowling expanded the title, to raise money for charity, into a faux primer on magical creatures, as in an Aubudon’s guide to birds, but for dragons and hippogriffs. This might be the first movie ever based on a syllabus. The Harry Potter films have conjured up billions at the box office; can you really blame Warner Bros.?  The problem with this spinoff is, like homework, you’d rather be doing something else with your time. As the end credits rolled, I half-expected to be handed a multiple choice test – please identify the Niffler; which one is the Demiguise? At least the monsters, when compared with their co-stars, have some personality. Considering the Potterverse is inhabited by some of the most enduring fictional characters in recent memory, the lack of equally fantastic humans is what gives Beasts a failing grade.", conclusion: "As they wander around, from desert plains to snowy fields to dark forests, and Newt introduces all his fantastic charges, Jacob can only stare, awestruck, in wonder. It reminds you of what made Harry Potter magical in the first place, and, if producers do their homework, what this new franchise could one day become.")

This dull heap of action-fantasy mediocrity, one which wants to be Game of Fangs, is the fifth.The first one to put Kate Beckinsale in coloured contacts, retractable incisors and painted-on pants was in 2003. So that makes the franchise more deathless than Twilight or television's True Blood. Though they were based on books, they had an ending.  But this series feels based on the perpetual time-loop of a videogame - there were attempts to release one in 2004, it tanked - and so long as the movies keep hitting the reset button, back comes 'Death Dealer' Selena (Beckinsale) to, um, deal some more death. Possibly at a discount for volume.", conclusion: "If a drunk but wise vampire dwarf had turned up I would have shouted 'housie'. But I did nod off for a few minutes, so I might have missed him. Maybe he'll be in the next one.")
Review.create(reviewer_id: 2, movie_id: 346672, score: 2, title: "Film review - Underworld: Blood Wars needs a new lease of life", content: "Following a brief recap of events thus far, Selene’s ostracised assassin is granted clemency by the vampire council, and returns home to train a new generation of warriors. Both vampires and Lycans are searching for Selene’s daughter Eve, the first ever pure-born hybrid, whose blood could be weaponised and used for world domination. With no knowledge of her daughter’s whereabouts, Selene has instead become their target, while David unearths a murderous coup within his own home that could tear the council apart. When she is inevitably betrayed once again, Selene flees north with David (Divergent’s Theo James) to a remote Nordic coven, only to face a newly mobilised Lycan army under the leadership of the formidable Marius (Tobias Menzies).  The Underworld series understands that its core selling point remains the acrobatic Beckinsale in body-hugging leather. Twilight has inadvertently helped maintain interest in the vampire/werewolf rivalry, but five films in, the formula is reaching the sharp end of its claw.", conclusion: "Blood Wars is certainly a step up from its nonsensical predecessor, Awakening (2012), and there are some standout scenery-chewing performances, not least Lara Pulver as scheming seductress Semira. Finishing with yet another cliffhanger, this isn’t the end for Selene, but the series is in desperate need of new blood and more bite in order to survive much longer.")
